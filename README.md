#  Smile for the State

*A narrative simulation exploring obedience, isolation, and digital erasure in the aftermath of democracy.*



## 🕹️ What Is This?

**Smile for the State** is an interactive fiction built in **Twine (SugarCube)**. Set in a near-future Post-America city after the collapse of democracy, you play as a citizen navigating life under the **Social Harmony Index (SHI)** — a regime-run scoring system that governs everything from housing to human connection.

Your continued existence is a courtesy of the Regime.
Your Social Harmony Index is under continuous review.
You may enter Simulation Mode at any time to improve your civic standing.
Feeling ready for more? Elevation is always an option — become your highest self in the cloud. 

## 🧠 Core Themes

- **Survival Through Submission** – You are alive, but only because you're useful or manageable.
- **Escapsim** – Reality is bleak. Simulation offers comfort.



## 🧪 Game Format

- Built in **Twine**, with branching choices and subtle stat tracking (SHI).
- Multiple **emotional arcs**: Conformist, Drifter, Romantic, Dissident.
- Minimal UI. Maximum psychological tension.
- A dystopia where nothing “bad” happens — you’re just gently removed from relevance.
